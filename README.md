Building a set of catchment and stream attributes for Geofabric v3

River scientists and water industry practitioners in Australia have realised great value from the [National Environmental Stream Attributes](https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/api/records/d00f1d10-e3c8-2185-e044-00144fdd4fa6) data set that links a variety of descriptive catchment statistics and metrics to the river network segments of the [Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric v2.x](http://www.bom.gov.au/water/geofabric/index.shtml)

The National Geofabric v3 has now been released with higher resolution mapping and new river network and catchment identifiers.  There is now a gap where the v2 Environmental Stream Attributes have not been generated for Geofabric v3 and to our knowledge no upgrade is planned.

Join us to help scope and generate a new set of catchment and river attributes linked to the Geofabric v3.  We will use water management in the Murray-Darling Basin as an initial focus with a view to using the Geofabric v3 environmental attributes to help inform interpretation and scaling up of monitoring and evaluation outcomes recorded by [the Flow-MER program](https://flow-mer.org.au/).  The use of national data sets and generic code linked to the Geofabric v3 identifiers will provide the groundwork for generating a new National Environmental Stream Attributes data set for Geofabric v3.
